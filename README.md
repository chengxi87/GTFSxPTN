# GTFSxPTN

``GTFSxPTN`` is a Matlab tool for constructing various Public Transport Network (PTN) graph representations at different scales using the [General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/). The tool is aimed for research and education on PTNs, such as topological and spatial analyses. 

The tool is currently still under development and test.
